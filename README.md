# 🕋 Prayer Times in Riyadh — Web Frontend Prototype

This is a lightweight HTML prototype displaying the prayer times in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It's the early front-facing concept of a broader spiritual and technical project that's deeply personal to me — one tied to my desire to make **Hijrah (migration for the sake of Allah)**.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project is more than just a table — it's a hands-on journey into the **foundations of web development**. Here's a breakdown of what I implemented and what I gained:

### 🔹 The `<meta charset="utf-8">` Tag
Through this element, I learned how important character encoding is in ensuring a web page properly displays a wide range of characters — especially when working with Islamic names, Arabic text, or multilingual environments.

- UTF-8 is now my go-to encoding.
- It allows support for special characters — essential for a global-facing application like this.

### 🔹 CSS Linking & Styling Concepts
While currently using a placeholder `reset.css` and a reference to `style.css`, I realized how browsers render elements differently by default. A reset file smooths those differences out — and will later help me apply a **unified look** across browsers.

My `style.css` file is **under development**, and this project will be updated to reflect that. Stay tuned!

## 🌍 Future Vision

This project is the **frontend seed** of something much more impactful.

### 💡 Why I'm Building This
As someone working toward making Hijrah, I might find myself asking:
> *"So what time do they usually pray there?"*

Rather than Googling that every time, I can build an app that:
- Displays **accurate prayer times based on real-time data**
- Offers **dynamic location selection**
- Integrates **IslamicFinder API** or similar services
- Supports both **web and mobile** interfaces

## 🐍 Backend Aspirations (Python Coming Soon)

I plan to expand this project by adding:
- A **Python backend (perhaps Flask or Django)** to fetch live prayer data
- **Open to further suggestions!**

Eventually, I'd like to containerize this app using Docker and deploy it on a platform like Heroku or Railway.

## 📌 Features So Far

- Static HTML table of Riyadh prayer times
- Semantic layout using headings, tables, and footers
- External link for prayer time reference with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security
- Preparations for external styling (`style.css`) and font use via Google Fonts

## 📆 Today's Snapshot
This page shows **Riyadh's prayer times for 5/22**, hardcoded for now — but it sets the foundation for a live, backend-powered update system.
